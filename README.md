Default Methods and Automatic Calculation:
The `ngOnInit()` method is automatically triggered when the component is initialized. It calls two default methods:
   1. `showDefaultValuesAfterRefresh()`: This method sets all input variables to their default values. When users refresh the calculator, it resets to the default configuration.
   2. `callAllMethods()`: This method calculates all the required values based on the default input values, providing immediate insights to the user upon loading the calculator.

The `Options` variable defines the settings for a slider component used in the UI to adjust percentages.


1. `defaultAnzahlArbeiter`: Default number of employees in the company (100).
2. `defaultGehaltProMa`: Default average annual salary per employee (49200).
3. `defaultGewinnProMa`: Default average annual profit per employee (8000).
4. `defaultKrankheitstageProMA`: Default average number of sick days per employee (10.9).
5. `defaultAbgaengeLetztesJahr`: Default number of employee departures in the previous year (30).
6. `defaultArbeitstageProMonat`: Default number of working days in a month (20).
7. `defaultAnkuendigungKuendigungMonate`: Default notice period for employee resignation in months (2).
8. `defaultWiederbesetzungMonate`: Default time taken to fill a vacancy after an employee leaves in months (4).
9. `defaultEinarbeitungszeitMonate`: Default time required to onboard a new employee in months (6).
10. `defaultNegativeKostenRekrutierungMA`: Default costs associated with recruiting a new employee (1000).
11. `defaultPercentageIllness`: Default percentage of reduction in sick days for potential savings (10).
12. `defaultPercentageReplacement`: Default percentage of reduction in employee replacements for potential savings (10).


# MyCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
